SO MAY THE OUTWARD SHOWS BE LEAST THEMSELVES: THE WORLD IS STILL DECEIVED WITH ORNAMENT. IN LAW, WHAT PLEA SO TAINTED AND CORRUPT, BUT, BEING SEASONED WITH A GRACIOUS VOICE, OBSCURES THE SHOW OF EVIL? IN RELIGION, WHAT DAMNED ERROR, BUT SOME SOBER BROW WILL BLESS IT AND APPROVE IT WITH A TEXT, HIDING THE GROSSNESS WITH FAIR ORNAMENT? THERE IS NO VICE SO SIMPLE BUT ASSUMES SOME MARK OF VIRTUE ON HIS OUTWARD PARTS: HOW MANY COWARDS, WHOSE HEARTS ARE ALL AS FALSE AS STAIRS OF SAND, WEAR YET UPON THEIR CHINS THE BEARDS OF HERCULES AND FROWNING MARS; WHO, INWARD SEARCH'D, HAVE LIVERS WHITE AS MILK; AND THESE ASSUME BUT VALOUR'S EXCREMENT TO RENDER THEM REDOUBTED! LOOK ON BEAUTY, AND YOU SHALL SEE 'TIS PURCHASED BY THE WEIGHT; WHICH THEREIN WORKS A MIRACLE IN NATURE, MAKING THEM LIGHTEST THAT WEAR MOST OF IT: SO ARE THOSE CRISPED SNAKY GOLDEN LOCKS WHICH MAKE SUCH WANTON GAMBOLS WITH THE WIND, UPON SUPPOSED FAIRNESS, OFTEN KNOWN TO BE THE DOWRY OF A SECOND HEAD, THE SKULL THAT BRED THEM IN THE SEPULCHRE. THUS ORNAMENT IS BUT THE GUILED SHORE TO A MOST DANGEROUS SEA; THE BEAUTEOUS SCARF VEILING AN INDIAN BEAUTY; IN A WORD, THE SEEMING TRUTH WHICH CUNNING TIMES PUT ON TO ENTRAP THE WISEST. THEREFORE, THOU GAUDY GOLD, HARD FOOD FOR MIDAS, I WILL NONE OF THEE; NOR NONE OF THEE, THOU PALE AND COMMON DRUDGE 'TWEEN MAN AND MAN: BUT THOU, THOU MEAGRE LEAD, WHICH RATHER THREATENEST THAN DOST PROMISE AUGHT, THY PALENESS MOVES ME MORE THAN ELOQUENCE; AND HERE CHOOSE I; JOY BE THE CONSEQUENCE!
