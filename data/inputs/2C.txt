It's funny. All you have to do is say something nobody understands and they'll do practically anything you want them to. I'm serious. If a person says something kind of crazy and nobody understands him, he can get away with anything in the world. That's one reason I don't like to have anything to do with people much. They always bust you if you're not careful.
But, boy, when you're dead, they really fix you up. I hope to hell when I do die somebody has sense enough to just dump me in the river or something. Anything except sticking me in a goddam cemetery. People coming and putting a bunch of flowers on your stomach on Sunday, and all that crap. Who wants flowers when you're dead? Nobody.
And all you do is sit there. You don't have to worry about floods or hurricanes or riots or fires or all that kind of crap. You just sit there. And you're all dressed up and don't have a thing to do. I don't know. I swear to God I don't know.
What I really felt like, though, was committing suicide. I felt like jumping out the window. I probably would've done it, too, if I'd been sure somebody'd cover me up as soon as I landed. I didn't want a bunch of stupid rubbernecks looking at me when I was all gory.
One thing I hate, you know what I mean? You take girls to a dance, you take them some place, you have to make conversation. You can't just sit there. You got to think up something to say.
Boy, that's a phoniness. That's a part I can't stand. That's all everybody in the world is doing, trying to think up some good line to say so that everybody'll like you. And the whole idea of it makes me so tired I can hardly keep my eyes open.
