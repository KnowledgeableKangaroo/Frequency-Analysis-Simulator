Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were
hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferry-
boat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the ines-
sential houses began to melt away until gradually I became
aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sail-
ors’ eyes — a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its van-
ished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s house,
had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all
human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must
have held his breath in the presence of this continent, com-
pelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood
nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with
something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.
And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I
thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green
light at the end of Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this
blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he
could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was
already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity
beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on
under the night.
Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that
year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no
matter — to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms
farther... . And one fine morning ——
So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back cease-
lessly into the past.
